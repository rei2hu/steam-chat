# steam-chat
Steam chat for shell/terminal/command line for people who don't want to install steam but still
want to chat but also don't want to use web browser steam for some reason.

Requires at least a width of 85 characters horizontally and like 15 characters vertically to even
begin to draw the UI properly.

### Features
- Chat with your online friends
- Shows unread message notifications as in there is an asterisk in the tab with unread messages.

### Known Issues
- Unicode breaks the alignment
- Too many friends online will also break the alignment (probably)
- ~~If the screen is redrawn (any update) while typing, you lose sight of your current input~~

### Not tested yet
- Friends removing you and stuff

### Planned
- ~~Refactoring the ugly draw UI code~~
- ~~Saving chat history~~
- Custom input handling
- Custom 'window; formatting
